Tommykay 1v1 mod 


Joe Mama says you should: 
Download the desktop client from Github.
In the program, File -> Clone -> URL -> RobloxFanboy86/1v1mod.
Set the local directory as your documents > Paradox Interactive > Hearts of Iron IV > mod folder.
Clone the project and download.
Be sure to create a .mod file or use the one included in the 1v1mod folder.
Create a personal branch of the mod via Branch -> New branch in the client.
Be sure to periodically go to 'Branch -> Update from beta-edits' to keep your files up to date.
All edits you make will automatically display in the client. If you are sure of your changes, put your handle in the summary box and a summary of your work in the description section.
Lastly, use the push button in the client to add your files to your branch.
